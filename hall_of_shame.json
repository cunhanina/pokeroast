Not Alakazams, not even Kadabras, but *Abras*. They have the bulk of a wet tissue and get OHKO'd by literally anything that breathes in this meta. Fearow is an absolute joke; it's outclassed by every other bird in existence and brings nothing to the table but a guaranteed free switch for your opponent. Then you have *two* Sawks, proving you either forgot what you put on your team or genuinely believe a frail, outsped Fighting-type with no niche in a world of Urshifu, Marshadow, and Zamazenta is a good idea. And Drifblim? Its only purpose is to die to Stealth Rock and then get swept by any competent attacker. This team has no hazard control, no reliable special attacker (unless your Abra is packing some secret Nuke that I'm unaware of), no actual bulk, and no answers for anything that matters. Dragapult, Calyrex-S, Eternatus, even a mildly annoyed Corviknight would wipe this entire squad. This isn't a team; it's a collection of 'mons begging to be deleted from the PC.

Picking both Charizard-Mega-X AND a Pok\u00e9mon that doesn't even exist, 'Mega Feraligatr,' isn't just an amateur mistake; it's a testament to your utter cluelessness about basic competitive rules. Did you think you could just manifest a new Mega into existence? And speaking of manifesting, how about you manifest some actual competitive Pok\u00e9mon instead of *Dragonair*? Seriously, in a format where Zacian-Crowned, Primal Groudon, and Geomancy Xerneas run rampant, you brought a pre-evolutionary noodle. Were you hoping it would evolve mid-battle by sheer willpower? Because it's going to get obliterated before it can even shed a tear. The rest of your team isn't much better. Charizard-X, Garchomp, Lucario... they're all perfectly fine *if* you were playing OU ten years ago, but here? They're glorified speed bumps for anything with a Pulse or a Moonblast. Your entire team looks like it stumbled out of a bad fanfiction, completely devoid of hazard control, defensive synergy, or any viable way to deal with the actual threats in National Dex (All). You'll be lucky to get a single KO before your team gets swept faster than you can say 'What's a Zacian?' It's not a team; it's a collection of missed opportunities and fundamental misunderstandings, topped off with a non-existent Mega and a Pok\u00e9mon that belongs in a petting zoo, not a competitive battlefield.",

What, did you forget where the Rare Candies were? This isn't some casual playthrough where you can walk through the Distortion World with unevolved Pok\u00e9mon; this is where Calyrex-Shadow and Zacian-Crowned run free. Your Dragonair is going to be setup fodder for literally anything that breathes, getting knocked out by Stealth Rock damage alone before it even dares to move. You'll make Wattson's Magnemite look like a world-ending threat compared to how fast that thing will die. Feraligatr and Jolteon? Bless your heart, they're so outclassed by almost every other water or electric type in the format they might as well be holding 'Please Faint' signs. Charizard-X and Garchomp are solid, but they can't carry this entire team of dead weight. You've essentially entered a Pok\u00e9mon World Championship with three starters and two actual competitive threats. You're not going to beat a single Tera Raid with this, let alone a half-decent opponent.

Feraligatr and Jolteon are doing their best to pretend it's still Gen 4, while your Lucario and Garchomp are good Pok\u00e9mon shackled by the rest of this mediocrity. Mega Charizard X is the only thing truly salvaging a shred of viability, but even it can't carry this dead weight. The pinnacle of your strategic genius, however, is undoubtedly Dragonair. What exactly is the plan here? Are you hoping Cynthia will be so offended by your NFE Pok\u00e9mon that she forfeits? Or are you aiming for a 'Spirit of Evolution' award?

Your Alakazams will be Karen's punching bags, and don't even *think* about showing this electric-psychic fan club to Lance's Dragonites.

First off, Rayquaza. Seriously? Did you just go 'ooh, big green dragon, good for team!'? That's not a strategy, that's just being lazy. It\u2019ll get you through the main game, sure, but try bringing that to the Battle Tower against a Palmer with a Regigigas and tell me how your 'skill' holds up. Most facilities outright ban legendaries like that, leaving you with five Pok\u00e9mon and a massive hole in your 'plan'. Now, for the actual Pok\u00e9mon: Swampert is solid, good typing, but anything Grass-type immediately ends its career. Gyarados with Intimidate is great, but that 4x Electric weakness? Wattson would have been a joke for Swampert, but the Frontier has Electrics that will one-shot your big fish without breaking a sweat. And Aggron? High defense, sure, but you're just begging for a Guts Machamp or an Earthquake to turn it into scrap metal. That 4x Fighting and Ground weakness is a glaring billboard advertising 'EASY KNOCKOUT'. But the real head-scratcher here, the absolute low point of this 'team', is Ninetales. Ninetales! Why? Its stats are mediocre, its movepool in Gen 3 is a joke, and it contributes virtually nothing that a Blaziken, Arcanine, or even a freakin' Torkoal couldn't do better. You've got an objectively terrible Fire-type when Hoenn has so many better options. You're going to get absolutely bodied by Glacia\u2019s Walrein with this excuse for a Fire-type, and Drake's dragons will laugh as they sweep your entire squad. This isn't a team; it's a random assortment of 'cool-looking' Pok\u00e9mon and a legendary crutch. You're going to crash and burn faster than a Magikarp against an Electric-type.",
